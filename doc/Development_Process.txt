DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
==================================

I am making Exile first and foremost for personal use. That fact will guide decisions.

Exile is public because I like that other people enjoy it too, it required public content to make, community input helps with bug fixing and design, and it allows the possibility that the project will continue after I move on.

Current Aims: to add all missing features.

Process: Each update will aim to focus on one area of incomplete content, plus some fixes and balancing. Once development is started on an update, it will be released no sooner than 3 months.

After release of an update the project will be on hold until I decide to start development again. Circumstances could mean the project goes on hold for long periods, or indefinitely.

Community involvement: help with fixes and issues is appreciated. I don't have the time or skills to do everything. Assistance frees me up for the more important task of designing and adding missing features.
However, issues raised may be given low priority if they don't bother me personally or don't match the aims of the current update. The easier people make things for me, the more likely the issue will be addressed.
I am unlikely to engage when the project is on hold. I'm not always in a position to engage with forums etc, so I apologize if I look like I'm ignoring you.

Bear in mind that because Exile is in Alpha many minor issues will get ignored. Features may get replaced, removed, or rewritten anyway, so there's little point perfecting them at this stage.

To report bugs, fixes, or suggestions check out the Minetest forums or Github:

(Opening Github issues is preferred to simply leaving comments on forums. It's easier to keep track of.)
